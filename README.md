Not sure if license is correct, adding this for now until i iron things out. unless i use other code that requires me to change this license though i intend to keep it as MIT, so until this readme is updated, please keep in mind any interim use of code that requires a different license


if you are trying to put in a PR, please work from DEVELOP and put PR into DEVELOP not into Master

Master should be stable and DEVELOP may not be, so i kept the default as master

Of course, this project is just starting so nothing is stable or working
